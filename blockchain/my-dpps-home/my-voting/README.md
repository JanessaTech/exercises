### How to start

For local test:

1. Check out code https://github.com/JanessaTech/exercises/tree/master/solidity
2. Go into the solidity, install dependences by running `npm intall`
3. Start remixd(make sure you installed it on local, if not, run command `npm install -g @remix-project/remixd`) by running `remixd.cmd`(in windows) or `remixd`(in linux)
4. Start local harthat under the solidity directory by running `npx hardhat node`
5. Go to online remix, connect localhost first, deploy MyVoting.sol under solidity\contracts\voting using harthat as provider
6. Install MetaMask, configure the network to connect to the local hardhat
7. Import at least two accounts generated by hardhat by default into MetaMask
8. Update contractAddr in constants.js under src/Constant to the address of MyVoting.sol deployed in #5
9. Start react when you are sure everything above is ready by running `npm start`

For testnet( Sepolia):

1. Make sure you've had an account in Infura and created a new API key
2. Deploy https://github.com/JanessaTech/exercises/tree/master/solidity/contracts/voting/MyVoting.sol using remix or hardhat or whatever you like
3. Update the address of MyVoting.sol deployed on Sepolia to be the value of contractAddr in src/Constant/constants.js
4. Start react when you are sure everything above is ready by running `npm start`
